### How do you compare stocks with each other?
### How do you compare a stock's performance?

Our approach: 

* Only the total turnover of the sold share is considered
* All taxes and trading fees are not taken into account
* Our liquidity is infinite
* We buy or sell all stocks at all times when it suits our investment strategy
* Only one unit of a share is considered in a period of time, i.e. only one unit of the share is bought or sold, no further shares are bought
* We expect all transactions to be successfully completed without any issues or delays
* We look at all stocks individually and each one on its own, each stock has its own asset
* At the end of the reviewed time all remaining shares are sold
* In this way, the profits of the individual shares are compared and a ranking can be created from this
